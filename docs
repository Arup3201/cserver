## Sockets

### What is a socket?

It seems like a communication channel between 2 computers and transfers data between them.

In C language, if I want to create a socket then I need `socket`.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<sys/socket.h>

int main() {
        int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
        printf("fd=%d\n", fd);
        return 0;
}
```
